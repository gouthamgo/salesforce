# OOPs Concepts 

## Object 

- An object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods. 
- For example "car" a real life object with characteristics --> color,type,model,horsepower and performs certain actions like drive.
- The characteristics of an Object are called properties in Object-Oriented-Programming and the actions are called methods.
- An Object is an instance of a Class. 

``` 
A method in Javascript is a property of an object whose value is a function
```
### Object can be created in 2 ways in Javascript 

- Using an Object Literal
- Using an Object Constructor

## Classes 

- A class can have many objects because class is a template while objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.
```
Javascript doesnt have classes rather it defines behaviour using a constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype.
```

`` Even the classes provided by ECMA2015 are objects  ``

## Encapsulation

- The process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit is known as encapsulation.
- Sometimes encapsulation refers to hiding of data or data Abstraction
``  There are no access modifiers in Javascript to restict the scope of the variable  but there are certain ways by which we can restrict the scope of the variables wihin the class/object``

## Inheritance

- It is a concept in which some properties and methods of an Object are being used by another Object. 
- IN Javascript the objects inherits objects
